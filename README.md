# Towers-of-Hanoi

Implementation of Towers of Hanoi using the Stack abstract data type. 

The Towers of Hanoi consist of three pegs and a collection of rings that stack on the pegs. The rings are different sizes and are stacked on the first peg in decreasing order of their size in units (in this case, in inches), and the second and third pegs are initially empty. The goal is to move all the rings from the first peg to the second peg so that they are stacked in decreasing order. 
A ring may NOT be placed on top of a ring with a smaller diameter (this rule applies to all three pegs).  There are three pegs so that rings can be temporarily placed onto a peg and moved as needed.
